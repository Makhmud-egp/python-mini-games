Number Guessing Game
--------------------
A fun console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

Features:
- 3 difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that determine allowed attempts
- Number range is 1 to 20
- Input validation for non-numeric guesses
- "Close" hints if the guess is within 3 numbers of the answer
- Displays remaining attempts after each guess
